# React-Reddit
### This is a work in progress!

This is a React+Flux application which interacts with the Reddit API, and (will) show(s) the user:

* Their front page
* Their messages
* Subreddit search
* And more stuff when I get around to adding it

This project is an effort to learn React, Flux, ES6, and improve on some other things

That being stated, it should not be used as a reference for proper coding in React/Flux

Improvements are welcomed!
